Hi! Bryant here! ðŸš€

My name is Bryant, developer, I like software architecture, cats and making projects 

- I am currently working as a Full Stack Developer using Typescript, React, Node and [BeyondJS](https://beyondjs.com/).
- I am currently working on separating from the Full Stack Developer position to concentrate on the backend
- I am just now learning [C, Data Structures and Algorithms](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/) to learn how programming really works and what it really does beyond a high level language. ðŸŒ±
- My idea in the medium term is to separate myself from the Javascript ecosystem and specialize in backend using programming languages with better performance, and from there start studying about cloud, microservices, TDD, DDD, basically software architecture. 
- I'm constantly putting into practice the concepts I learn in personal open source projects, if you have a question about any of them, send me a DM
- If you know about C, DSA, Software Architecture or have any questions about the side projects I have, [Im on Twitter](https://x.com/BryantDev_)
